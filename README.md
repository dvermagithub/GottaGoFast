# GottaGoFast
This is the project webpage for MSCS 5610 Data Mining (Spring 2019) Team GottaGoFast.

# Context & Acknowledgement
For this project we are exploring the dataset from Formula 1 racing available from http://ergast.com/mrd/. The Ergast Developer API is an experimental web service which provides a historical record of motor racing data for non-commercial purposes. The API provides data for the Formula One series, from the beginning of the world championships in 1950. The data was originally gathered and published to the public domain by Chris Newell.
Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One World Championship) is the highest class of single-seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. 

# Content
This dataset contains data from 1950 all the way through the 2018 season, and consists of tables describing race results, constructors results, constructors, race drivers, lap times, pit stops, qulification results, and many more as per the scheme provided at http://ergast.com/schemas/f1db_schema.txt

# Outcomes
As the project proceeds, this page will be updated. The repository contain the original data download and additional folders include various stages of the Data Mining process as utilized with this data set.
